# S.3 The TypeScript Compiler (and its Configuration)

## Using “Watch Mode”

watch mode: That means we can tell TypeScript to watch a file, and whenever that file changes, TypeScript will recompile.

`tsc app.ts --watch` or `tsc app.ts -w`

## Compling the Entire Project / Multiple Files

`tsc --init` : this is only required once. It will initialize this project in which you run this command as a TypeScript project.
