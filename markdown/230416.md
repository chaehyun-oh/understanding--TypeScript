# S.5 Classes & Interfaces

## What are Classes?

### Classes & Instances

-   “Blueprints for objects” (theoretical definition)
-   Define how objects look like, which properties and methods they have
-   Classes make creation of multiple, similar objects much easier

## Creating a First Class

```tsx
class Department {
	name: string;

	constructor(n: string) {
		this.name = n;
	}
}

const accounting = new Department("Accounting");

console.log(accounting);
```

## Constructor Functions & The “this” keyword

```tsx
class Department {
	name: string;

	constructor(n: string) {
		this.name = n;
	}

	describe() {
		console.log("Department: " + this.name);
	}
}

const accounting = new Department("Accounting");

// console.log(accounting);

accounting.describe();

const accountingCopy = { name: "dummy", describe: accounting.describe };

accountingCopy.describe();
```

## “private” and “public” Access Modifiers

```tsx
class Department {
	name: string;
	private employees: string[] = [];

	constructor(n: string) {
		this.name = n;
	}

	describe() {
		console.log("Department: " + this.name);
	}

	addEmployee(employee: string) {
		this.employees.push(employee);
	}

	printEmployeeInfo() {
		console.log(this.employees.length);
		console.log(this.employees);
	}
}

const accounting = new Department("Accounting");

// console.log(accounting);

accounting.addEmployee("Max");
accounting.addEmployee("Anna");

// accounting.employess[2] = "Jane"; //ERROR
```
