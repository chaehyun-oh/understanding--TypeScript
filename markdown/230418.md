# S.5 Classes & Interfaces

## A First Interface

: An Interface describes the structure of an object. We can use it to describe how an object should look like.

```tsx
interface Person {
	name: string;
	age: number;

	greet(phrase: string): void;
}

let user1: Person;

user1 = {
	name: "Max",
	age: 30,
	greet(phrase: string) {
		console.log(phrase + "" + this.name);
	},
};

user1.greet("Hi there I am ");
```

## Using Interfaces with Classes

: When you define something as an interface, it’s super clear that you want to define the structure of an object with that.

The reason why you often work with interfaces is that an interface can be used as a contract a class can implement and a class then has to adhere to.

```tsx
interface Greetable {
	name: string;

	greet(phrase: string): void;
}

class Person implements Greetable {
	name: string;
	age = 30;

	constructor(n: string) {
		this.name = n;
	}

	greet(phrase: string) {
		console.log(phrase + "" + this.name);
	}
}

let user1: Greetable;

user1 = new Person("Max");

user1.greet("Hi there I am ");
```

## Readonly Interface Properties

: Is readonly thereafter so that is can’t be changed after the object has been initialized.

```tsx
interface Greetable {
	readonly name: string;

	greet(phrase: string): void;
}
```

## Interfaces as Function Types

```tsx
// type AddFn = (a: number, b: number) => number;
interface AddFn {
	(a: number, b: number): number;
}

let add: AddFn;

add = (n1: number, n2: number) => {
	return n1 + n2;
};
```

## Optional Parameters & Properties

: Specify an optional property by adding a question mark after the property name

```tsx
interface Named {
	readonly name: string;
	outputName?: string; // '?' means optional
}
```
