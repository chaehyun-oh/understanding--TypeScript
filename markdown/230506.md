# S.11 Using Webpack with TypeScript

## What is Webpack & Why do we need it?

: Webpack is a tool that will help us bundle our files together.

### What is Webpack?

-   Webpack is Bundling & “Build Orchestration” Tool
-   “Normal” Setup
    -   Multiple .ts files & imports (Http requests)
    -   Unoptimized code (not as small as possible)
    -   “External” development server needed
-   With Webpack
    -   Code bundles, less imports required
    -   Optimized (minified) code, less code to download
    -   More build steps can be added easily
